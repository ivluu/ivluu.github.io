                    <p>
                        Growing up an only child and having to obtain most of my knowledge on my own is a big reason why I am more intrigued by things than people. With very few
                        resources to guide me, I was forced to learn from my mistakes, avoiding shortcuts because I wasn't aware of any. There is nothing more satisfying
                        to me than taking something apart and putting it back together just to see how it works. If that something breaks, then I just have another mistake I need
                        to learn from. I'm the type of person who would rather build things than buy things, which usually ends up being a dangerous rabbit hole, but that topic can 
                        be discussed at another time. Every desktop I have ever owned was built on my own, along with all the table tennis paddles in my collection. I also enjoy 
                        motorsports, hoping to one day build a car that I can destroy and rebuild constantly. Overtime, I feel like the numerous mistakes I've made when exploring a 
                        topic hands-on have given me a better understanding of them than if I were to explore those topics through the experience of others. Thankfully, I have parents 
                        who blindly support me through all my endeavors, and a supportive group of friends who enable all my decisions becuase that's what friends do. So, if I'm not 
                        striving to succeed for myself, I'll at least do it for them.

                    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                    <p>
                        Much of my taste has been built off of my hobbies and interests. My most commonly visited are fashion, film, and cars. I could probably write a blog
                        for everything that gives me inspiration, but to keep things short, here's a list of things that have fueled my creativity.
