                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Growing up an only child and having to obtain most knowledge on my own is a big reason why I am more intrigued by things than people. With very few
                        resources to guide me, I was forced to learn mostly from my mistakes, avoiding shortcuts because I didn't know of any. There is nothing more satisfying
                        to me than taking something apart and putting it back together just to see how it works. If that something breaks, then I just have another mistake I need
                        to learn from. I'm the type of person who would rather build things than buy things. Every desktop I have ever owned was built on my own, along with all the
                        table tennis paddles in my collection. I am also a huge car enthusiast, hoping to one day build a car that I can destroy and rebuild constantly. Overtime,
                        I feel like the numerous mistakes I've made when exploring a topic hands-on have given me a better understanding of them than if I were to learn about them
                        from someone else. Thankfully, I have parents who blindly support me because they grew up in a time where my interests, hobbies, and choice of career path 
                        were less relevant. So, if I'm not striving to succeed for myself, I'll at least do it for them.

                    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                    <p>
                        Much of my taste has been built off of my hobbies and interests. My most common ones are fashion, film, and cars. I could probably write a blog
                        for everything that gives me inspiration, but to keep things short, here's a list of things that have fueled my creativity.
